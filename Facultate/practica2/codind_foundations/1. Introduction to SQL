1. Introduction to SQL

    What is SQL?
        Understanding the role and importance of SQL in database management.
        Brief history and evolution of SQL.
    Setting Up Your Environment:
        Installing a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
        Introduction to database tools (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQLite Browser).

2. Basics of SQL

    Database and Table Creation:
        Creating databases and tables.

        sql

    CREATE DATABASE my_database;
    USE my_database;
    CREATE TABLE employees (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      position VARCHAR(100),
      salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

Inserting Data:

    Inserting records into tables.

    sql

        INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary)
        VALUES ('John Doe', 'Manager', 60000.00);

3. Querying Data

    Basic Select Statements:
        Retrieving data from tables.

        sql

    SELECT * FROM employees;
    SELECT name, position FROM employees;

Filtering Data with WHERE:

    Using the WHERE clause to filter results.

    sql

        SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
        SELECT * FROM employees WHERE position = 'Manager';

4. Advanced Querying Techniques

    Sorting Results with ORDER BY:
        Sorting query results.

        sql

    SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
    SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY name ASC;

Limiting Results with LIMIT:

    Limiting the number of results returned.

    sql

        SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 5;

5. Functions and Aggregations

    Using Aggregate Functions:
        Applying aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN.

        sql

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;

Grouping Data with GROUP BY:

    Grouping results and using aggregate functions.

    sql

        SELECT position, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY position;

6. Joining Tables

    Understanding Joins:
        Introduction to different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN).

        sql

        SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department
        FROM employees
        INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

    Advanced Join Techniques:
        Using multiple joins and understanding join conditions.

7. Subqueries and Nested Queries

    Writing Subqueries:
        Using subqueries to filter and retrieve data.

        sql

        SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

    Correlated Subqueries:
        Understanding and using correlated subqueries.

8. Modifying Data

    Updating Records:
        Using the UPDATE statement to modify data.

        sql

    UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE id = 1;

Deleting Records:

    Using the DELETE statement to remove data.

    sql

        DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

9. Managing Database Objects

    Creating and Managing Indexes:
        Improving query performance with indexes.

        sql

    CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);

Creating Views:

    Creating and using views to simplify complex queries.

    sql

CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;
