1. Introduction to Data Analysis

    What is Data Analysis?
        Understanding the role and importance of data analysis.
        Overview of the data analysis process: collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.
    Setting Up Your Environment:
        Installing a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
        Introduction to database tools (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQLite Browser).

2. Data Collection and Import

    Importing Data:
        Loading data into SQL from CSV, Excel, and other formats.

        sql

        LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.csv' INTO TABLE table_name
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
        ENCLOSED BY '"'
        LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
        IGNORE 1 ROWS;

    Connecting to External Data Sources:
        Using SQL to connect to external databases and APIs.

3. Data Cleaning and Preparation

    Handling Missing Values:
        Identifying and dealing with missing data.

        sql

    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'default_value' WHERE column_name IS NULL;

Data Transformation:

    Normalizing and standardizing data.

    sql

    UPDATE table_name SET column_name = LOWER(column_name);

Removing Duplicates:

    Identifying and removing duplicate records.

    sql

        DELETE FROM table_name
        WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name);

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Descriptive Statistics:
        Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

        sql

        SELECT AVG(column_name), MEDIAN(column_name), STDDEV(column_name) FROM table_name;

    Data Visualization:
        Using SQL to generate basic visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts) through integrated tools or exporting to visualization software like Tableau or Power BI.

5. Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

    Aggregation and Grouping:
        Using aggregate functions and the GROUP BY clause.

        sql

    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id;

Window Functions:

    Applying window functions for advanced calculations.

    sql

        SELECT name, salary,
               RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
        FROM employees;

6. Time Series Analysis

    Working with Date and Time Data:
        Manipulating and analyzing date and time data.

        sql

    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date_column, '%Y-%m') AS month, COUNT(*)
    FROM table_name
    GROUP BY month;

Time Series Functions:

    Using SQL functions to perform time series analysis.

    sql

        SELECT date_column, 
               LAG(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY date_column) AS previous_value,
               LEAD(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY date_column) AS next_value
        FROM table_name;

7. Correlation and Regression Analysis

    Correlation Analysis:
        Calculating correlation coefficients to understand relationships between variables.

        sql

    SELECT column1, column2, CORR(column1, column2) AS correlation
    FROM table_name;

Regression Analysis:

    Performing linear regression to model relationships.

    sql

        SELECT column1, column2, 
               REGR_SLOPE(column2, column1) AS slope,
               REGR_INTERCEPT(column2, column1) AS intercept
        FROM table_name;

8. Hypothesis Testing

    Conducting Hypothesis Tests:
        Using SQL for hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.

        sql

        SELECT AVG(column_name) AS avg_value,
               COUNT(*) AS sample_size,
               STDDEV(column_name) AS std_dev
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

9. Data Visualization and Reporting

    Creating Dashboards:
        Building interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or integrating with web applications.
    Generating Reports:
        Automating report generation with SQL.

10. Practical Applications

    Case Studies:
        Analyzing real-world datasets to uncover insights.
