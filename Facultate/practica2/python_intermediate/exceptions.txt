===Exceptions===
You have already seen exceptions in previous code. They occur when something goes wrong, due to incorrect code or input. When an exception occurs, the program immediately stops.
Different exceptions are raised for different reasons. 

Common exceptions:

ImportError: an import fails;

IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number;

NameError: an unknown variable is used;

SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly; 

TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;

ValueError: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but with an inappropriate value.
===Exception Handling===
When an exception occurs, the program stops executing.

To handle exceptions, and to call code when an exception occurs, you can use a try/except statement.

The try block contains code that might throw an exception. If that exception occurs, the code in the try block stops being executed, and the code in the except block is run. If no error occurs, the code in the except block doesn't run.
A try statement can have multiple different except blocks to handle different exceptions.

Multiple exceptions can also be put into a single except block using parentheses, to have the except block handle all of them.
An except statement without any exception specified will catch all errors. These should be used sparingly, as they can catch unexpected errors and hide programming mistakes.
===finally, else===
After a try/except statement, a finally block can follow. It will execute after the try/except block, no matter if an exception occurred or not.
The else statement can also be used with try/except statements. 

In this case, the code within it is only executed if no error occurs in the try statement.
===Raising Exceptions===
You can throw (or raise) exceptions when some condition occurs. 

For example, when you take user input that needs to be in a specific format, you can throw an exception when it does not meet the requirements.

This is done using the raise statement.
Exceptions can be raised with arguments that give detail about them.
