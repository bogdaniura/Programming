===Classes===
The focal point of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are objects, which are created using classes.

The class describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself. In other words, a class can be described as an object's blueprint, description, or definition.

You can use the same class as a blueprint for creating multiple different objects. 

Classes are created using the keyword class and an indented block, which contains class methods (which are functions). 

The __init__ method is the most important method in a class. 

This is called when an instance (object) of the class is created, using the class name as a function.

All methods must have self as their first parameter, although it isn't explicitly passed, Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods. Within a method definition, self refers to the instance calling the method.

Instances of a class have attributes, which are pieces of data associated with them.

In this example, Cat instances have attributes color and legs. These can be accessed by putting a dot, and the attribute name after an instance. 

In an __init__ method, self.attribute can therefore be used to set the initial value of an instance's attributes.

Classes can have other methods defined to add functionality to them. 

Remember, that all methods must have self as their first parameter.

These methods are accessed using the same dot syntax as attributes.
===Inheritance===
Inheritance provides a way to share functionality between classes. 

Imagine several classes, Cat, Dog, Rabbit and so on. Although they may differ in some ways (only Dog might have the method bark), they are likely to be similar in others (all having the attributes color and name). 

This similarity can be expressed by making them all inherit from a superclass Animal, which contains the shared functionality. 

To inherit a class from another class, put the superclass name in parentheses after the class name.
A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass.

A class that is inherited from is called a superclass.

If a class inherits from another with the same attributes or methods, it overrides them. 
The function super is a useful inheritance-related function that refers to the parent class. It can be used to find the method with a certain name in an object's superclass.
===Magic Methods & Operator Overloading===
Magic methods are special methods which have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. 

They are also known as dunders. 

So far, the only one we have encountered is __init__, but there are several others. 

They are used to create functionality that can't be represented as a normal method. 

One common use of them is operator overloading. 

This means defining operators for custom classes that allow operators such as + and * to be used on them.

An example magic method is __add__ for +. 
More magic methods for common operators:

__sub__ for -

__mul__ for *

__truediv__ for /

__floordiv__ for //

__mod__ for %

__pow__ for **

__and__ for &

__xor__ for ^

__or__ for |

The expression x + y is translated into x.__add__(y). 

However, if x hasn't implemented __add__, and x and y are of different types, then y.__radd__(x) is called. 

There are equivalent r methods for all magic methods just mentioned.
Python also provides magic methods for comparisons.

__lt__ for <

__le__ for <=

__eq__ for ==

__ne__ for !=

__gt__ for >

__ge__ for >=

 If __ne__ is not implemented, it returns the opposite of __eq__. 

There are no other relationships between the other operators.
There are several magic methods for making classes act like containers.

__len__ for len()

__getitem__ for indexing

__setitem__ for assigning to indexed values

__delitem__ for deleting indexed values

__iter__ for iteration over objects (e.g., in for loops)

__contains__ for in

There are many other magic methods that we won't cover here, such as __call__ for calling objects as functions, and __int__, __str__, and the like, for converting objects to built-in types.
===Data Hiding===
A key part of object-oriented programming is encapsulation, which involves packaging of related variables and functions into a single easy-to-use object -- an instance of a class.

A related concept is data hiding, which states that implementation details of a class should be hidden, and a clean standard interface be presented for those who want to use the class. 

In other programming languages, this is usually done with private methods and attributes, which block external access to certain methods and attributes in a class.

The Python philosophy is slightly different. It is often stated as "we are all consenting adults here", meaning that you shouldn't put arbitrary restrictions on accessing parts of a class. Hence there are no ways of enforcing that a method or attribute be strictly private. 
Weakly private methods and attributes have a single underscore at the beginning.

This signals that they are private, and shouldn't be used by external code. However, it is mostly only a convention, and does not stop external code from accessing them.
Strongly private methods and attributes have a double underscore at the beginning of their names. This causes their names to be mangled, which means that they can't be accessed from outside the class. 

The purpose of this isn't to ensure that they are kept private, but to avoid bugs if there are subclasses that have methods or attributes with the same names.

Name mangled methods can still be accessed externally, but by a different name. The method __privatemethod of class Spam could be accessed externally with _Spam__privatemethod.
===Class & Static Methods===
Methods of objects we've looked at so far are called by an instance of a class, which is then passed to the self parameter of the method.

Class methods are different -- they are called by a class, which is passed to the cls parameter of the method. 

A common use of these are factory methods, which instantiate an instance of a class, using different parameters than those usually passed to the class constructor. 

Class methods are marked with a classmethod decorator.
Static methods are similar to class methods, except they don't receive any additional arguments; they are identical to normal functions that belong to a class. 

They are marked with the staticmethod decorator.
===Properties===
Properties provide a way of customizing access to instance attributes. 

They are created by putting the property decorator above a method, which means when the instance attribute with the same name as the method is accessed, the method will be called instead. 

One common use of a property is to make an attribute read-only.
Properties can also be set by defining setter/getter functions.

The setter function sets the corresponding property's value.

The getter gets the value.

To define a setter, you need to use a decorator of the same name as the property, followed by a dot and the setter keyword.

The same applies to defining getter functions.
